abstract: Modern financial markets contain many investors. In this context, we study the role of information in investor decision-making, and the informational efficiency and liquidity of the market. An equilibrium is characterized in closed-form for a continuous-time economy with many market participants and imperfect competition, in which investors receive private information with varying quality, and are heterogeneous in their misperception of the information quality. In equilibrium, investor heterogeneity in their misperception generates return predictability by investors’ trading, and trading of different investors follows a simple factor structure with weak factors. To conduct empirical analysis that builds on these equilibrium implications, we develop a new big-data econometric method that utilizes the factor structure to accommodate the high-dimensionality of these implications. Applying the framework to price and institution holding data of the US stock market, we document that individual institution’s trading with impotent predictive power can collectively generate significant return predictability that persists for about a quarter. We estimate dynamic price impact of around 0.25 at quarterly frequency, a moderate misperception of institutions on their information quality, and institutions’ contributions to the informational efficiency of the market.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
#summary: We conduct inference on volatility with noisy high-frequency data. We assume the observed transaction price follows a continuous-time Itô-#semimartingale, contaminated by a discrete-time moving-average noise process associated with the arrival of trades. We estimate volatility, defined as #the quadratic variation of the semimartingale, by maximizing the likelihood of a misspecified moving-average model, with its order selected based on an #information criterion. Our inference is uniformly valid over a large class of noise processes whose magnitude and dependence structure vary with sample #size. We show that the convergence rate of our estimator dominates n1/4 as noise vanishes, and is determined by the selected order of noise dependence #when noise is sufficiently small. Our implementation guarantees positive estimates in finite samples.
